# Semantic HTML

- Learn about the concept of semantic HTML.
- Semantic HTML means writing HTML that is descriptive and meaningful in regards to content and context.
- It is important to write semantic HTML for accessibilities reasons ..etc.
- Learn how our HTML creates an outline using both headings and HTML5 sectioning elements.
- We will even gain insight into accessibility concepts and how using different elements changes how those using assistive technologies perceive our webpages by testing our project with a screen reader.
- Have a solid understanding of how you can write better, semantic HTML.

## Useful tool

- ChromeVox extention: Screen Reader, we can use it to verify the accessiblity of the website.

## Some notes

### Heading

- Is it starting new section?
  
  - yes: Using appropriate Heading Level Tag
  - no: Use `<p>` tag
  
### Outline Summary

- Use Sectioning Elements to create logical sections
- Use headings to create implicit sections

## Final Notes on Semanticism

- Machines are not smart enough to understand the meaning of content
- HTML elements (when possible) should be descriptive of content
- There is not always one way to do it (... but try your best :))
- Honot the ourline with headings and sectioning elements
- Help a machine, help a human.
